DMK entered the electoral fray for 1957 State Assembly elections with [[M Karunanidhi]] winning the [[Kulithalai]] constituency while other seniors members like [[V. R.

===== Elections under Karunanidhi's Presidency =====

* In the '''1977''', DMK lost the Assembly elections to MGR's AIADMK, and stayed out of power in the state till 1989.<ref name="Murali82">[[#Murali|Murali 1994]], p. 82</ref> After MGR's death in December 1987, AIADMK split into two factions between [[V. N. Janaki|Janaki]] (MGR's wife) and [[Jayalalithaa]]. DMK returned to power in 1989 State assembly elections and Karunanidhi took over as chief minister in January 1989.
* in the '''1991''' election was held on the backdrop of DMK government dissolved within 2 years of formation due to pressure from Rajiv gandhi, in the same year Rajiv was killed by Human bomb during election campaign. Due to DMK's pro Tamil stance and the dismissal of the state government mid way by Rajiv, people's presumption was against DMK and the sympathy wave in favour of AIADMK–Congress alliance and the DMK was deprived of any seats in the Parliament.
* In the '''1996''' state elections, DMK came to power on strength of corruption charges against [[J.Jayalalithaa]] and the alliance with [[Tamil Maanila Congress]] (TMC), headed by [[G.K. Moopanar]] and supported by cine actor [[Rajinikanth]]. However, in 2001, the AIADMK, on strength of a strong alliance and the incumbency factor against DMK, came back to power in the state assembly elections.
* In the '''2004''' parliamentary elections, DMK formed an alliance with Congress, the [[Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (MDMK) and the [[Pattali Makkal Katchi]] (PMK) and swept a grand Victory, the alliance winning all 40 seats including [[Puducherry]]. This enabled 7 ministerial posts in the Central government and influential power to DMK.
* Two years later in '''2006''', the same alliance won in the state assembly elections and the DMK for the first time formed a minority government in the state with help from Congress. [[M Karunanidhi]] became the Chief Minister of the state for the fifth time. The DMK-Congress alliance was also successful in the 2009 parliamentary elections.
* In the [[2011 Tamil Nadu legislative assembly election result|2011 Assembly elections]], held in the wake of the [[2G case]] and allegations of nepotism, the DMK won only 23 seats, 127 seats less than earlier.
* In the 2014 [[Lok Sabha]] election DMK failed to win any seats; however, by vote percentage it was second only to AIADMK.
* in the 2016 state assembly elections gave DMK 89 MLA's. The most number for an opposition party in the history of Tamil Nadu legislative assembly.

The interim report of Justice [[Jain Commission]], which oversaw the investigation into [[Rajiv Gandhi]]'s [[Assassination of Rajiv Gandhi|assassination]], indicted Karunanidhi for abetting the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE).<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.india-today.com/itoday/17111997/cov.html|last=Chawla|first=Prabhu|magazine=India Today|title=Jain Commission Revelations: Damning the DMK|accessdate=11 November 2013|date=17 November 1997|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924034354/http://www.india-today.com/itoday/17111997/cov.html|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The interim report recommended that Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.

===Allegations of nepotism===
Karunanidhi's nephew, [[Murasoli Maran]], was a [[Union Minister]]; however, it has been pointed out that he was in politics long before Karunanidhi became the Chief Minister in 1969.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.indiainfo.com/2003/11/23/23maran1.html|title=Maran&nbsp;– the eyes and ears of DMK in Delhi|publisher=Indiainfo.com|accessdate=11 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617023328/http://news.indiainfo.com/2003/11/23/23maran1.html|archivedate=17 June 2011}}</ref>

Many political opponents and DMK party senior leaders have been critical of the rise of M. K. Stalin in the party. But some of the party men have pointed out that Stalin has come up on his own.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.india-today.com/itoday/19991101/stalin.html|title=Politics: Special Series; M K Stalin|work=India Today|date=1 November 1999|accessdate=11 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924034411/http://www.india-today.com/itoday/19991101/stalin.html|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Karunanidhi has been accused of helping Murasoli Maran's son [[Kalanidhi Maran]], who runs [[Sun Network]], India's second largest television network. According to Forbes, Kalanidhi is among India's richest 20, with $2.9&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/10/billionaires-2010_The-Worlds-Billionaires_CountryOfCitizen_11.html | work=Forbes | title=The World's Billionaires Page 11 of 41 | date=10 March 2010|accessdate=11 November 2013}}</ref>
